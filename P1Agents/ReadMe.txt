Combat agent sends one footman to the enemy lines in order to draw out their ranks.
Then, all of the other agents attack the incoming forces.
Currently, only two footmen are killed, but it is an improvement over the
default behavior which kills none.
If we were to improve this, we would make it so when our forces attack theirs
they dont enter the range of the tower, although we were unable to do so.
