Week 1: Astar search correctly finds a path to the goal and executes it, but it has to reverse the stack order, and can't navigate around moving enemy footmen

Note: unknown is David Kerrigan, I had to repush the code and readme because my changes got deleted from the repository.

Week 2: The footman goes around the other footman. Also checks to see if there is a footman on the map so that Astarsearch can still be run on maps without a footman. 
	Could not find working implementation of an override for hashCode(), we tried many different options for doing this, but when testing .contains() on two same MapLocations
	we would always get false.
